# tivoli-light-installation
 Repo containing Processing3 LED (WS2811) control script, simple Arduino code used for the E18-D80NK sensor input controle and a Fadecandy mapping config file as used for 
 the installation. Both the Processing3 control program and the Fadecandy server was made to run on the Asus Tinkerboard S SBC and is heavily based on the "grid wave" Fadecandy example.
 The code was written for an installation made for the "winter in Tivoli" exhibition, Copenhagen Feb.  2019.
